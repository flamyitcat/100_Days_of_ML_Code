# 100 Days of ML Code

### Day 0: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Open a repo for 100 days of ML Code challenge

**Thoughts:** I start use github to log my challenge

**Link to work:** NIL

### Day 1: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Reading the math knowledge for deep learning

**Thoughts:** Refresh my memory about linear algebra. Although keep reading some post about deep learning and research related to my project, still want to build the fundamental first.

**Link to work:** NIL

### Day 2: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Build a NN using no ML libraries

**Thoughts:** THis is quite a good way to remember the structure and the process of a neural network

### Day 3: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Study CNN and build a CNN withou ML library

**Thoughts:** I follow to make a CNN without ML libraries. However, this is quite difficult to handle the convolution part(e.g. how to move the filter)

### Day 1: February 30, 2016 (Example 2) 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on KhanAcademy.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
